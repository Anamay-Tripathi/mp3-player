1) Tkinter

The Tkinter library is most popular and very easy to use and it comes with many widgets (these widgets help in the creation of nice-looking GUI Applications).

Also, Tkinter is a very light-weight module and it is helpful in creating cross-platform applications(so the same code can easily work on Windows, macOS, and Linux)

from tkinter import *

2) Pygame module


Pygame is a Python module that works with computer graphics and sound libraries and is designed with the power of playing with different multimedia formats like audio, video, etc. While creating our Music Player application, we will be using Pygame's mixer.music module for providing different functionality to our music player application that is usually related to the manipulation of the song tracks.

Command used to install the pygame module is:

pip install pygame
import pygame
